"""Public API: autotunable kernel functions.

Each function takes an :class:`AdjacencyForwardBackwardWithNodeBuckets` graph
and node features, dispatches to fused CUDA kernels, and supports an optional
``autotune=True`` kwarg that runs a grid search over kernel/graph parameters
on first call, then caches the best configuration.
